# **Is a Cereal, Healthy?** 
### A hierarchical clustering adventure

## WHAT MAKES A CEREAL HEALTHY? 
What exactly makes a cereal healthy? Are the cereals we believe to be healthy, truly healthy? After one of my chidren (I am removing any names to protect their privacy) needed an increase in fiber, I began the adventure of finding cereals that they could eat and would allow their system to flow more freely (if you catch my drift...). 

I am using the USDA, FDA, and other reputable sources to determine the attributes of a healthy cereals. I will state my assumptions of what is considered healthy below and will be using those as a guide for determining the types of clusters and to assist my recommendations.

**HEALTHY GUIDELINES**

* **Sugar content:** .25g of sugar for every 4g of cereal. 
  + (**Reference**: https://www.fns.usda.gov/tn/choose-breakfast-cereals-are-lower-sugar)

* **Fiber at least 3 grams per serving** 
  + (**Reference**: https://foodcorps.org/cms/assets/uploads/2018/01/Healthy-School-Program-Resource-Guide-1-11.pdf)

* **Sodium content:**
  + Low sodium: 5% or less per serving size
  + High sodium: 20% or more per serving size
  + (**Reference**: https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet)

**NOTE** I do not include fat content because fat can be healthy depending on the type which isn't stated in the dataset. Also, vitamins are not broken into types in this dataset so it is difficult to use that as an indicator since many cereals add vitamins.

Enjoy discovering how unhealthy some of the cereals we all believe are healthy but really are not...
